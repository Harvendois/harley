Star

Bright is my dawn
Moody is my eclipse
Traveling lightyears, your shine comes again
today, to illuminate me
Sometimes clouds would block us
And i will miss you for days
But i will also remember
The faithful existence of your cordialness in my life

Here comes my greed
I hope you, and your dazzling shine was mine
But it is a dream
You are too high away
I gaze at you, faithfully shining at me
And I think
I want to love you
