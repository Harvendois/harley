Flower

You are a flower
A white flower that sprouted overnight
I found you and was surprised
Surprised by how you would appear out of nowhere 
and would embroider my mornings

The bees try for your nectar
The fat bee, the skinny bee, 
the conspicuous bee, the common bee,
Every bee loves you
I too, want to keep you

But if I deflower, you will die,
and if I pick you, you will wither away
I am powerless
I can only gaze at you,
While i can
